A C/C++ project designed to simplify shellcode creation on any compilers using C. Supports x86_64, x86_32 and practically any architecture and OS.

## ℹ️ Overview & theory
A shellcode is an offset-independent assembly code which can be executed from any part of program. Those are commonly used by cyber-security engineers, hackers and lowlevel developers (anticheats, protections, etc). This project presents a way to create shellcodes easily in pure C, without any ASM usage, allowing to write universal shellcodes across architectures/platforms.
